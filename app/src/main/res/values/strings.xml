        on the outer ring of the game board to claim it.
        Players alternate turns claiming tiles.
        A player must claim a tile that matches either the color or the numeral of the
        previously claimed tile.
        \n\n
        In the image below, the black player last claimed Yellow 1.
        On its turn, the white player may claim any remaining 1 (Green and Blue)
        or any remaining Yellow (2, 3, and 4).
