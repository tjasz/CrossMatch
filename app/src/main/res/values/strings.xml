    <string name="help_text">Player One begins by claiming a tile on the edge of the board.
        Thereafter, players alternate claiming tiles.
        The next tile claimed must match the previous claimed tile in either number or color.
        A player wins by claiming all the tiles in a row, columns, diagonal, TODO square.
        A player may also win by claiming a tile which cannot legally be followed.
        In other words, a tile that is the last of both its color and its number.
